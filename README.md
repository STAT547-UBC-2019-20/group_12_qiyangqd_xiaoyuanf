# Group 12: Beijing PM2.5
This is the project repository for Group 12 in STAT547M in the University of British Columbia. The project is an assessment of PM2.5 pollution from 2010 to 2014 in Beijing, China.

Margot Chen, Qi Yang

## Project Interest
Beijing, the capital city of China, has been fighting against `PM2.5` pollution in recent years. `PM2.5` are fine airborne particles less than 2.5μm that can cause severe damage to human health. __Meteorological conditions__(wind, humidity, etc) can contribute to the formation of `PM2.5` according to previous studies. We are interested in whether there are correlations between Beijing’s `PM2.5` concentration and  meteorological conditions. If so, analyzing meteorological conditions can help us assess and even predict the air quality in Beijing.   

## Data Description
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00381/PRSA_data_2010.1.1-2014.12.31.csv) we used is from [University of California Irvine Machine learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data#). It was originally uploaded by Songxi Chen in Peking University, China. This is an hourly dataset containing `PM2.5` concentration and __meteorological statistics__ from Jan 1st, 2010 to Dec 31st, 2014.   

## Plans
We are trying to address whether Beijing's `PM2.5` is correlated with meteorological conditions(dew point, temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, rain or snow) and time(year, month, day). Our steps include: data cleaning, correlation tests, linear regression analyses, plotting, dashboard creation.
